# Covid-19-Detection-using-Chest-X-rays
Chest diseases are very serious health problems in the life of people. These diseases  include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, and lung  diseases such as right now “COVID-19”. The timely diagnosis of chest diseases is very  important. Application of deep learning techniques can be helpful for the accurate detection of  the “COVID - 19”, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized  physicians in remote villages.This project would involve taking X-ray images as input and  classifying the chest disease that person is linked with by performing certain Convolutional  Neural networks (CNN) techniques on that image.
