# Covid-19-Detection-using-Chest-X-rays
Chest diseases are very serious health problems in the life of people. These diseases  include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, and lung  diseases such as right now “COVID-19”. The timely diagnosis of chest diseases is very  important. Application of deep learning techniques can be helpful for the accurate detection of  the “COVID - 19”, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized  physicians in remote villages.This project would involve taking X-ray images as input and  classifying the chest disease that person is linked with by performing certain Convolutional  Neural networks (CNN) techniques on that image.


Requirement Analysis
Features that have been implemented in our application and are the core of the application are the following modules: 
1.	Dataset of X Rays(Covid positive and covid negative)
2.	Model(for classifying the x ray in covid positive and covid negative)
3.	Login module
4.	Flask based web application
5.	Remotemysql database for user authentication and registering

Under our project we will be using Chest X-Rays to detect whether the person is infected with covid-19 or not.To implement this we will be using one of the best image detection algorithm named: Inception V3. This model will use the concept of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is specifically designed for object detection. 
We will be using a dataset consisting of Covid-19 positive patient’s chest X-rays (lungs).We will be using different parameters to achieve the best accuracy and within a reasonable time. After the completion of our first phase, which is the back-end , we will focus on developing the front-end in which we will use the Flask framework for creating the web application for our project that will be helpful for the doctors to operate easily.
Our project will be specifically for the doctors to operate and our aim is not only to achieve the best accuracy and faster results but also the usage of this technology to remote locations which are affected by the global pandemic- covid-19.
